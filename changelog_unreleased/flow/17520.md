#### [HIGHLIGHT] Added a new official plugin `@prettier/plugin-hermes` (#17520 by @fisker)

`@prettier/plugin-hermes` is based on [Hermes JS Engine](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/blob/main/README.md).

This plugin include a new parser `hermes` (Flow syntax), to use this plugin:

1. Install the plugin

   ```sh
   yarn add --dev prettier @prettier/plugin-hermes
   ```

2. Add the following to your `.prettierrc` file

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - "@prettier/plugin-hermes"
   ```

Due to package size limitation, this plugin is not included in the `prettier` package, it needs to be installed separately.

**We plan to make this as the default parser for Flow syntax support in v4, we'll also remove `babel-flow` parser in v4, please give it a try.**

For more information, check [the package homepage](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/packages/plugin-hermes).

Many thanks to the Hermes team.
