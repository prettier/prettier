#### [BREAKING] Remove support for `babel-flow` parser and Flow syntax support in `babel` parser (#17359 by @17359)

<!--
TODO:
We may also move `flow` plugin into a separate package, or maybe add support for
`hermes` parser in v4, please make sure this is correct before we release v4.
-->

`babel-flow` parser was supported by Babel via internal plugin `flow` and `flowComments`.

They are no longer actively maintained, lack of new syntax support, we decide to remove `babel-flow` parser, please use `flow` parser instead.

:::warning

Before Prettier main, when using `babel` parser, if `@flow` or `@noflow` pragma detected, we also redirect to `babel-flow` parser automatically, this feature also not supported anymore. Means that if you are using these pragmas in your `.js` file without an explicit parser configured, you need configure them to use `flow` parser too.
