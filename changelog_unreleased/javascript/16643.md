#### Removed support for experimental syntax (#16643, #16705 by @fisker)

- `DecimalLiteral` - The [Decimal proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decimal) decided not introduce new syntax. The `decimal` plugin will be removed from Babel 8.
- `importReflection` - The "Import Reflection" proposal has renamed as ["Source Phase Imports"](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports)

- [Disclaimer about non-standard syntax](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html#disclaimer-about-non-standard-syntax)
