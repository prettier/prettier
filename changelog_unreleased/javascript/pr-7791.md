#### Ultimate fix for Closure-style type casts ([#7791](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7791) by [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

Prettier has been trying not to corrupt these JSDoc type assertions since [v1.6.0](https://prettier.io/blog/2017/08/29/1.6.0.html#handle-closure-compiler-type-cast-syntax-correctly-2484httpsgithubcomprettierprettierpull2484-by-yangsuhttpsgithubcomyangsu), with mixed results. As type checking based on JSDoc becomes increasingly common, we've been getting new bug reports about this syntax. The bugs were tricky because the required parentheses around the expression weren't part of the AST, so Prettier didn't have a good way to detect their presence. Finally, we used the `createParenthesizedExpressions` option of the Babel parser to represent parentheses in the AST using non-standard nodes. This helped fix all the reported bugs.

Consequently, Prettier won't recognize JSDoc type casts if the `flow` or `typescript` parser is used, but this is reasonable as this syntax makes little sense in Flow and TypeScript files.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Input
const nestedAssertions = /** @type {MyType} */
  (/** @type {unknown} */
      (x));

// Prettier stable
const nestedAssertions /** @type {MyType} */ /** @type {unknown} */ = x;

// Prettier master
const nestedAssertions = /** @type {MyType} */ (/** @type {unknown} */ (x));
```
