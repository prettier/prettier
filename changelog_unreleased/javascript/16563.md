#### Don't remove useless `\` in string literals (#16563 by @sosukesuzuki, #16763 by @fisker)

Previously, Prettier would remove useless escape characters (`\`) from string literals. However, this behavior was inconsistent as it did not apply to template literals, which was reported in [issue #16542](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/16542).

This issue is a feature request to extend this behavior to template literals as well.

After discussing this internally, the Prettier team concluded that removing useless escape characters, whether in string literals or template literals, is the responsibility of a linter, not a formatter.

This change disables the removal of useless escape characters in string literals across all languages supported by Prettier. To keep the previous behavior, we recommend using ESLint rules like [`no-useless-escape`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-useless-escape).

Escaped quotes (e.g. `"\"\'"`) may get unescaped when changing between different quotes. This is explained on the [Rationale](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html#strings) page of the official documentation.
