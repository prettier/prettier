#### Fix JSDoc comments broken by ASI semicolon with `semi: false` (#18307 by @jagadish-555)

When `semi: false` is configured, Prettier inserts a semicolon for ASI protection. Previously, this was inserted after attached comments, separating JSDoc `@type` comments from their target expressions. This fix ensures the semicolon is printed before the comments.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
/** @type {string} */
(foo);

// Prettier stable
/** @type {string} */
;(foo);

// Prettier main
;/** @type {string} */
(foo);
```
