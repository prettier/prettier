1. Choose a folder based on which language your PR is for.

   - For JavaScript, choose `javascript/` etc.
   - For TypeScript specific syntax, choose `typescript/`.
   - If your PR applies to multiple languages, such as TypeScript/Flow, choose one folder and mention which languages it applies to.

2. In your chosen folder, create a file with your PR number: `XXXX.md`. For example: `typescript/6728.md`.

3. Copy the content below and paste it in your new file.

4. Fill in a title, the PR number and your user name.

5. Optionally write a description. Many times itâ€™s enough with just sample code.

6. Change ```jsx to your language. For example, ```yaml.

7. Change the `// Input` and `// Prettier` comments to the comment syntax of your language. For example, `# Input`.

8. Choose some nice input example code. Paste it along with the output before and after your PR.

#### Ignore single files with `@noformat` / `@noprettier` (#17344 by @wnayes)

Individual files can now opt out of formatting via `@noformat` or `@noprettier` "pragma" comments at the top of the file.

Use the new option `--check-ignore-pragma` (`checkIgnorePragma` via configuration / API) to enable support for this feature.

Language plugins can [implement support](https://prettier.io/docs/plugins#parsers) for this feature. Most built-in parsers were updated to support this feature already, including JavaScript (TypeScript), CSS, HTML, JSON, Markdown (MDX), YAML, and GraphQL.

```jsx
/**
 * @noformat
 */

export matrix(
  1, 0, 0,
  0, 1, 0,
  0, 0, 1
);
```
