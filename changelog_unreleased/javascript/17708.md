#### Add support for "Discard Bindings" proposal (#17708 by @fisker)

The Stage 2 proposal ["Discard Bindings"](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-discard-binding) is now supported via Babel. Also keep in mind our [policy on non-standardized syntax](https://prettier.io/docs/en/rationale.html#disclaimer-about-non-standard-syntax) before using this proposed syntax feature with Prettier.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
const [a, void] = iter; // author intends to consume two elements
// vs.
const [a, void, void] = iter; // author intends to consume three elements
```
