#### Preserve trailing double spaces in JSDoc (#18594 by @seiyab)

Some tools treat these spaces as meaningful.

```javascript
await require('prettier').format('/**\n * With 2 spaces   \n */', {parser: 'babel'});

# Prettier stable
// -> '/**\n * With 2 spaces\n */\n'

# Prettier main
// -> '/**\n * With 2 spaces  \n */\n'
```
