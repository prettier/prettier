#### Add additional Playwright test functions (#17876 by @BPScott)

Prettier already avoids changing indentation for test functions when you add `.skip` to
them. It now also treats the Playwright functions [`test.fixme`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-fixme), [`test.describe.skip`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-skip) and [`test.describe.fixme`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-describe-fixme) similar to `test.skip`.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
test.fixme("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});

test.describe.skip("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});

test.describe.fixme("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});

// Prettier stable
test.fixme(
  "does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test",
  () => {
    // code
  },
);

test.describe.skip(
  "does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test",
  () => {
    // code
  },
);

test.describe.fixme(
  "does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test",
  () => {
    // code
  },
);

// Prettier main
test.fixme("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});

test.describe
  .skip("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});

test.describe
  .fixme("does something really long and complicated so I have to write a very long name for the test", () => {
  // code
});
```
