#### [HIGHLIGHT] Added a new official plugin `@prettier/plugin-oxc` (#17472, #17483 by @fisker)

`@prettier/plugin-oxc` is based on [OXC](https://oxc.rs/)(A **fast** JavaScript and TypeScript parser in Rust).

This plugin includes two new parsers `oxc` (JavaScript syntax) and `oxc-ts` (TypeScript syntax), to use this plugin:

1. Install the plugin

   ```sh
   yarn add --dev prettier @prettier/plugin-oxc
   ```

2. Add the following to your `.prettierrc` file

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     - "@prettier/plugin-oxc"
   ```

Due to package size limitations, this plugin is not included in the `prettier` package, it needs to be installed separately.

For more information, check [the package homepage](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/tree/main/packages/plugin-oxc).
