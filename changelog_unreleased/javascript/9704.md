#### Fix node ends at `rangeStart` was formatted (#9704 by @fisker)

Previously a node ends at `rangeStart` in considered in range, now it's excluded.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Prettier stable
foo = 1.0000;bar = 1.0000;baz=1.0000;
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Range

// Prettier stable
foo = 1.0;
bar = 1.0;baz=1.0000;

// Prettier master
foo = 1.0000;bar = 1.0;baz=1.0000;
```

_This effect other languages support range format too._
