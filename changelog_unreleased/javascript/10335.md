#### [HIGHLIGHT] Prevent wrapping object properties with short keys (#10335 by @thorn0)

Line breaks after short property names in object literals often look unnatural. Even when such a line break yields a line length benefit of 1 or 2 characters, it rarely looks justified. Prettier main avoids line breaks after property names shorter than `tabWidth + 3`. The "+3" part has been chosen rather arbitrarily. It may be revised upward in future versions, provided there is a really good rationale.

// Prettier stable

};

// Prettier main
const importantLink = {

};
```
