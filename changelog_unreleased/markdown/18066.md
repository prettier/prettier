#### Fix endless indentation of multi-line HTML comments in lists (#18066 by @user)

Multi-line HTML comments inside list items were getting additional indentation on each format, causing them to drift further right.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```markdown
<!-- Input -->
- Something:
  - [ ] Foo
  - [ ] Bar
        <!--
          Something else
        -->

<!-- Prettier stable (after 2 formats) -->
- Something:
  - [ ] Foo
  - [ ] Bar
        <!--
                  Something else
                -->

<!-- Prettier main -->
- Something:
  - [ ] Foo
  - [ ] Bar
        <!--
          Something else
        -->
```
