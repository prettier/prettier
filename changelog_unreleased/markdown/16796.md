#### Treat U+30A0 & U+30FB in Katakana Block as CJK (#16796 by @tats-u)

Prettier doesn't treat U+30A0 & U+30FB as Japanese. U+30FB is commonly used in Japanese to represent the delimitation of first and last names of non-Japanese people or “and”. The following “C言語・C++・Go・Rust” means “C language & C++ & Go & Rust” in Japanese.

U+30A0 can be used as the replacement of the `-` in non-Japanese names (e.g. “Saint-Saëns” (Charles Camille Saint-Saëns) can be represented as “サン゠サーンス” in Japanese), but substituted by ASCII hyphen (U+002D) or U+FF1D (full width hyphen) in many cases (e.g. “サン=サーンス” or “サン＝サーンス”).
