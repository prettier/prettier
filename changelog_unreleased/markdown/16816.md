#### Tell regexp-util to generate regex compatible with u flag (#16816 by @tats-u)

CJK characters outside of BMP and Ideographic Variation Sequences (IVS; variation selectors dedicated for han/kanji), which consume 2 characters in JavaScript string, have not been treated as CJK. This is due to the fact that Prettier has not passed the appropriate flag `"u"` to the `regexp-util` package.

In the following example, “𠮷” (U+20BB7) is out of BMP, and “葛󠄀” is a combination of a han “葛” (U+845B) in BMP and an IVS U+E0100. The latter requires a font with the support of Adobe Japan-1 (e.g. Yu Gothic UI and Source Han Sans) to be rendered as a form different from that of the character without IVS (葛).
