#### Fix inconsistent alignment of multi-paragraph list items (#16929 by @mldangelo)

Subsequent paragraphs in list items now align consistently with the first paragraph, following CommonMark alignment rules.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Input -->
-   First paragraph.

    Second paragraph.

<!-- Prettier stable -->
- First paragraph.

    Second paragraph.

<!-- Prettier main -->
- First paragraph.

  Second paragraph.
```
