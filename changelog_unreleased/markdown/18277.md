#### [HIGHLIGHT] Upgrade parser to latest micromark (#18277 by @seiyab, @j-f1, @fisker)

We've upgraded Prettier's Markdown parser from the outdated remark-parse v8 to the modern micromark v4. This upgrade significantly enhances CommonMark and GFM compliance, resolves numerous long-standing parsing bugs, and lays a stronger foundation for future enhancements.

A huge thank you to @seiyab for their tremendous effort in driving this major upgrade!
