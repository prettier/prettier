#### Fix(Markdown): inserts newline in lists containing codeblock but skips last element (#17760 by @TYKevin)

Fixes #17731.

Minor refactor to derive Markdown list looseness from the ancestor listâ€™s spread property in the AST, instead of relying on a trailing newline character. And revert `loose-items.js` from #14372 for cross-platform consistency.

Additionally, this PR consolidates and mirrors logic from #17675 and #16637 into `isLooseListItem`, since all are used to determine list looseness.
