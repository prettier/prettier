#### Don't break a line a between Chinese or Japanese and others (#16691 by @tats-u)

Markdown documents are mainly converted to HTML or components of JavaScript-based frameworks. This means that paragraphs in Markdown are eventually processed by the browser according to [CSS rules](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-4/). This is because many Markdown converter preserve line breaks in paragraphs in input Markdown and HTML itself does not specify how browsers should handle line breaks in text in HTML.

According to [CSS rules (CSS Text Module Level 3 or later)](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-4/#line-break-transform), browsers should remove line breaks between Chinese/Japanese characters instead of replacing them with spaces. However, this rule has been ignored by WebKit-based or Webkit-derived browsers (Chrome, Safari, and so on) for long time.

For example, the following HTML paragraph:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<p>
日本語
汉语
漢語
<p>
```

generated from the following Markdown:

```md
日本語
汉语
漢語
```

should be rendered as follows according to CSS rules and actually is rendered such by Firefox:

```md
日本語汉语漢語
```

However, Chrome and Safari render it as follows:

```md
日本語 汉语 漢語
```

This is why we should stop Prettier from line breaking between Chinese/Japanese characters. We decided to stop Prettier from forcing users to use a plugin for a Markdown converter that concatenates lines that start or end with Chinese/Japanese characters ([remark-join-cjk-lines](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-join-cjk-lines), for example).

Also, [a line break between Chinese/Japanese and others are equivalent to a space](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/blob/076914a198bf3ac642001619e08acefdf607d61d/css-text/Overview.bs#L712) according to before [the commit suspending a concrete rule in CSS Text Module Level 3 by commenting it out](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/commit/b3bb0ed18b3168981c54c437bcfb5881ef49975b) fixing [an issue on the CSS Working Group Editor Drafts](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5086). Firefox follows this rule. Therefore, all browsers render the following paragraph:

````html
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<p>日本語 English 汉语 한국어 漢語</p>

<p></p>
````

as follows:

```md
日本語 English 汉语 한국어 漢語
```

However, Prettier has broken a line between Chinese/Japanese characters in Markdown for a long time, and between Chinese/Japanese and latin characters in some cases since 3.0.0. For example, the following Markdown paragraph:

```md
日本語English汉语
English
漢語
```

is formatted as follows if `--prose-wrap` is set to the other value than `preserve` in Prettier 3.x:

```md
日本語English汉语English漢語
```

However, the following HTML, which is generated by a Markdown-to-HTML converter based on the above Markdown:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<p>
日本語English汉语
English
漢語
</p>
```

is rendered as follows by all browsers:

```md
日本語English汉语 English 漢語
```

This is why we should stop Prettier from line breaking al　so around Chinese/Japanese characters in Markdown. We are going to conform Prettier's behavior to this rule in a future version. After that, line breaks between Chinese/Japanese and others will be allowed again under certain rules.

One of the few exceptions is spaces and line breaks between Chinese/Japanese and Korean letters. The following Markdown paragraphs are equivalent even in the current Prettier version:

```md
현재 韓國의 大統領은 尹錫悅이다.
```

```md
현재
韓國의
大統領은
尹錫悅이다.
```

You get the former if you format the latter with `--prose-wrap=always` and a sufficiently long `--print-width` value or with `--prose-wrap=never`, and you get the latter if you format the former with `--prose-wrap=always` with a extremely short `--print-width` value. Therefore, we do not have to touch such spaces and line breaks.

Another exception is those between a Chinese/Japanese character and a meaningful symbol in Markdown like `*`, `` ` ``, `[`, and `]`. For example, the following Markdown paragraph is equivalent even in the current Prettier version:

```md
**Yarn** のCLI経由でフォーマットするには `yarn prettier -w ` を実行してください。
```

```md
**Yarn**
のCLI経由でフォーマットするには
`yarn prettier -w .`
を実行してください。
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Input (--prose-wrap=always --print-width=20) -->
