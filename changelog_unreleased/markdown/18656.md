#### Treat U+3000 as CJK punctuation-equivalent and make sure to recognize U+FF5E as CJK punctuation again in Markdown prose wrap (#18656 by @tats-u)

We improved the text wrapping in Markdown written in Chinese and Japanese by treating some non Unicode punctuation characters as equivalent to CJK punctuation. A part of this was introduced in 3.5.0 ([#16832](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/16832)) but unintentionally dropped.

```bash
await require('prettier').format('测试 Test テスト Test\nU+3000\u{3000}\nU+301C\u{301C}\nU+FF5E\u{FF5E}\nU+1F221\u{1F221}\n', {parser: 'markdown', proseWrap: 'always'});
