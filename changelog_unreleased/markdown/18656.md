#### Make sure to recognize U+FF5E as punctuation again (#18656 by @tats-u)

U+FF5E ～ is not treated as a punctuation unlike U+301C 〜 (both are used in the same way in Japanese) in current Prettier. This should be fixed in 3.5.0 ([#16832](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/16832)), but a regression seems to have occurred.
