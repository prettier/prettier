#### Preserve line breaks within Angular control flow brackets for space-sensitive elements (#16591 by @sosukesuzuki)

The content inside control flow blocks is space-sensitive, meaning the following two pieces of code produce different outputs:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
@if (true) {foo}
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
@if (true) {
   foo
}
```

If the `--html-whitespace-sensitivity` option is not set to `ignore`, Prettier should preserve these line breaks. However, the current version of Prettier unintentionally adds a line break.

This change ensures that Prettier no longer adds line breaks that would affect the rendering.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Input -->
@if (true) {foo}

<!-- Prettier stable -->
@if (true) {
   foo
}

<!-- Prettier main -->
@if (true) {foo}
```
