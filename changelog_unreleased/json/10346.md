#### Stricter JSON parser (#10346, #10443, #10456 by @fisker)

Prettier internally uses a JavaScript expression parser to parse JSON. That's why the `json` and `json5` parsers used to be very forgiving and allowed all kinds of JavaScript expressions. Now they are much stricter, although some simple non-standard syntax is still allowed (e.g., [JSON6](https://github.com/d3x0r/JSON6) is supported, except for multiple minus signs: `----123`).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Input
[1, 2, 1 + 2]

// Prettier stable
[1, 2, 1 + 2]

// Prettier main
SyntaxError: BinaryExpression is not allowed in JSON. (1:8)
> 1 | [1, 2, 1 + 2]
    |        ^
```
