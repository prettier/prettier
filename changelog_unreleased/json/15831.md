#### [Highlight] New `jsonc` parser added (#15831 by @fisker)

Previously, we infer the parser of `.jsonc` files to be `json`, but if we want keep the trailing comma, we'll have to use a hacky workaround config `{parser: "json5", quoteProps: "preserve", singleQuote: false}`.

The new added `jsonc` parser:

- Always quote the object keys.
- Wrap strings with double quotes.
- Of course, respect [`trailingComma`](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options#trailing-commas) option.
