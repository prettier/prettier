#### Preserve number and string representation in `json-stringify` parser (#18405 by @fisker)

Previously, we printed numbers and strings with `JSON.stringify()`, but it loses the original representation sometimes. Eg: big/small numbers are wiped, special characters get unescaped. Technically, it doesn't change the value, but that's something the user expected. Prettier main keeps the original representation for them.
