#### Fix misplacement of comments from after an arrow to before it (#17421 by @o-m12a & @t-mangoe)

Prior to this fix, formatting arrow function declarations that met all of the following conditions could result in misplaced comments:

- The comment appears immediately after the arrow (=>).
- There is a line break following the comment.
- The function declaration includes a return type annotation.

In such cases, Prettier moved the comment from after the arrow to before it.
However, placing the comment before the arrow violates syntax rules enforced by TypeScript and Babel.

To avoid such issues, Prettier now preserves the original placement of the comment.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Input
const fn = (): any => /* comment */
null;

// Prettier stable
const fn = (): any /* comment */ => null

// Prettier main
const fn = (): any => /* comment */ null
```
