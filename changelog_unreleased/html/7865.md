#### Prefix-based multiline formatting for the `class` attribute (#7865 by @thorn0)

Formatting of HTML class names will now keep classes on one line until the line length limit is reached; at that point, consecutive classes with the same prefix will be grouped together on each line. For layout frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, which add many classes to an element, this is important for readability and maintainability vs. the previous behavior (keeping all classes on one line) or e.g. putting each class on its own line.
