#### Test whether passed globs are names of existing files before treating them as globs ([#7587](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7587) by [@fisker](https://github.com/fisker))

Since file names in Linux can contain almost any characters, strings like `foo*.js` and `[bar].css` are valid file names. Previously, if the user needed to format a file named `[bar].css`, a glob escaping syntax had to be used: `prettier "\[bar].css"` (this one doesn't work on Windows, where backslashes are treated as path separators) or `prettier "[[]bar].css"`. Because of this, important use cases were broken. E.g. [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) passes absolute paths and knows nothing about the escaping syntax. Now, when Prettier CLI gets a glob, it first tries to resolve it as a literal file name.
