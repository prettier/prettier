#### Skip explicitly passed symbolic links with `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` (#15533 by @sanmai-NL)

Since Prettier v3, we stopped follow symbolic links, however in some use cases, the symbolic link patterns can't be filtered out, and there is no way to prevent Prettier to throw errors.

In Prettier main, you can use `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` to simply skip it.
