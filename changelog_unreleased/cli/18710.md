#### Exclude `pnpm-lock.yaml` when expanding directory (#18710 by @fisker)

`pnpm-lock.yaml` file is ignored when expanding directory.

```console
# Prettier won't check `pnpm-lock.yaml` file
$ prettier . --check
Checking formatting...
All matched files use Prettier code style!
```

Explicit path to `pnpm-lock.yaml` files or glob patterns still include these files.

```console
$ prettier pnpm-lock.yaml
Checking formatting...
[warn] pnpm-lock.yaml
[warn] Code style issues found in the above file. Run Prettier with --write to fix.
```

```console
$ prettier "**/*"
Checking formatting...
[warn] pnpm-lock.yaml
[warn] Code style issues found in the above file. Run Prettier with --write to fix.
```
