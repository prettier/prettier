#### Added MCP server (#18565 by @fisker)

Prettier main adds support for a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP) server, enabling Prettier to interact with AI models and tools through a unified interface. This feature allows large language models (LLMs) to run Prettier in IDEs and other software. This feature is particularly useful for developers using AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot. Read the [documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/mcp) to learn how the MCP server can help you in your development tasks.

The implementation is heavily inspired by [@eslint/mcp](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/mcp).
