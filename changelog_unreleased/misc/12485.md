#### Make artifact friendly for webpack (#12485, #12511 by @fisker)

Fixes two problems when bundling our UMD files with webpack:

- A error `` `....__exportStar` is not a function`` throws when running the bundles.
- Some files cause warning about `"Critical dependency: the request of a dependency is an expression"`.
