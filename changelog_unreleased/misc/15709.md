#### Fix `cursorOffset` feature sometimes being catastrophically slow (#15709 by @ExplodingCabbage)

Previously, Prettier's `cursorOffset` feature would be spectacularly slow in certain unfortunate circumstances (namely when the user's cursor was not contained within a leaf node of the AST, and the non-leaf node containing it was very large and being significantly reformatted by Prettier). As a consequence, if you used Prettier via an editor integration that used `cursorOffset` under the hood, your editor would sometimes inexplicably hang when you tried to format a file.

All examples of this phenomenon that we are aware of should now be fixed, but bug reports of any further pathological examples would be welcome.
