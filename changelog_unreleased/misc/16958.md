#### Use ESM entrypoint for require if require(ESM) is enabled (#16958 bu @tats-u)

Node.js 22.12 or later can (experimentally) load ESM modules with `require` function. This change enables `require` to load Prettier without the CommonJS entrypoint with almost only the ability to import the ESM entrypoint.

The feature to load ES modules with `require` is not completely stable yet (but thought to be more stable than other experimental features that require flag arguments), so the following warning is now displayed when you load Prettier with `require`:

```
(node:23928) ExperimentalWarning: The REPL is loading ES Module path/to/node_modules/prettier/index.mjs using require().
Support for loading ES Module in require() is an experimental feature and might change at any time
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
```
