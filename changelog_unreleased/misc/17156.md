#### Remove `module-sync` condition (#17156 by @fisker)

In Prettier 3.5.0, [we added `module-sync` condition to `package.json`](https://prettier.io/blog/2025/02/09/3.5.0#use-esm-entrypoint-for-requireesm-16958-by-tats-u), but turns out it doesn't work if CommonJS and ESM plugins both imports builtin plugins. To solve this problem, we decide simply remove the `module-sync` condition, so `require('prettier')` will still use the CommonJS version, we'll revisit until `require(ESM)` feature is more stable.
