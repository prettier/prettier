title: "Prettier 3.8: Support for Angular v21.1"
---

We're excited to announce that Prettier now fully supports the fresh features landing in Angular v21.1 (released today 🎉)!

This update brings cleaner, more expressive templates with:
- Consecutive `@case` statements in `@switch` blocks.
- Spread elements (`...`) in array literals, object literals, and function calls inside templates.

We've also added the ability to format Angular syntax beautifully inside Markdown code blocks.

If you find Prettier valuable and want to help us keep pace with fast-moving frameworks like Angular, please consider [sponsoring us on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/prettier) or supporting the projects we rely on. Thank you for being part of this community — your support means a lot!
