title: "Prettier 3.7: Improved formatting consistency and new plugin features!"
---

We are excited to announce Prettier 3.7! This release focuses on polishing the TypeScript and Flow experience, specifically by aligning the formatting of classes and interfaces to be more consistent and predictable. We also want your opinion on the upcoming change to fix [inconsistent opening brace print logic of class and interface body](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/18115).

Additionally, we also fixed lots of bugs, added support for new features in Angular 21 and Graphql 16.12, added Front Matter support to Handlebars.

For plugin developers, we've added new APIs to give you more control over comment attachment and handling of ignored nodes.

If you appreciate Prettier and would like to support our work, please consider sponsoring us directly via [our OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/prettier) or by sponsoring the projects we depend on. Thank you for your continued support!
