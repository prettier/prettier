title: "Prettier 3.8: New features and bug fixes"
---

This release brings several improvements and bug fixes across multiple languages.

The highlight of this release is the upgrade of our Markdown parser from the outdated remark-parse v8 to the modern micromark v4. This significant upgrade enhances CommonMark and GFM compliance, resolves many long-standing parsing bugs, and provides a solid foundation for future improvements.

We've also added support for new Flow features including match patterns and records, Angular v21.1 features like multiple switch cases, and made numerous improvements to comment handling and formatting consistency across JavaScript, TypeScript, and other languages.
