title: "Prettier 2.8: improve --cache CLI option and TypeScript 4.9 syntax!"
---

This release includes improvements to the `--cache` option added in 2.7. A new `--cache-location` option has been added, and a bug that saved the cache even when `--write` wasn't specified has been fixed.

We're also adding support for TypeScript 4.9 syntax!
