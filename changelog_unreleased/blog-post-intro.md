title: "Prettier 3.1: New experimental ternaries formatting and Angular control flow syntax!"
---

This release adds indentation back to nested ternaries along with a new `--experimental-ternaries` flag to try a more novel "curious ternary" format that scales better to deeply nested conditionals. We are keen for [your feedback](https://forms.gle/vwEuboCobTVhEkt66) on the experimental format before it rolls out as the default behavior later this year!

We have also added support for the control flow syntax in Angular v17. For details on the syntax, please read [the official Angular release post](https://blog.angular.io/introducing-angular-v17-4d7033312e4b).
