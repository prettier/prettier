title: "Prettier 3.2: Lots of bug fixes and new features"
---

This release doesn't highlight any major new features, but includes a lot of bug fixes and improvements.

We are still seeking feedback for the `--experimental-ternaries` option released in Prettier 3.1. Please read [A curious case of the ternaries](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/13/curious-ternaries) and respond via the Google Forms link provided.

Additionally, we recommend reading [Prettier's CLI: A Performance Deep Dive](https://prettier.io/blog/2023/11/30/cli-deep-dive) by [Fabio Spampinato](https://github.com/fabiospampinato). This faster CLI is slated to be released as version 4.0.
