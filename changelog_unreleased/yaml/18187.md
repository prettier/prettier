#### Preserve document end marker `...` (#18187 by @fs0414)

Previously, Prettier incorrectly converted the YAML document end marker `...` to the document start marker `---` during formatting. This has been fixed to preserve the original marker.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```yaml
# Input
---
key: value
...
xxxxxxxx

# Prettier stable
---
key: value
---
xxxxxxxx

# Prettier main
---
key: value
...
xxxxxxxx
```
