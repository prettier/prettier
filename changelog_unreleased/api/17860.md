#### Allow `AstPath#call()` to access property of nullish properties (#17860 by @fisker)

Previously, to check for a possible non-existent child node, we had to ensure the node existed first.

```js
const isFoo = path.call(() => path.node?.type === "Foo", "foo", "bar");
// Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bar')
```

We have to

```js
const isFoo =
  path.node.foo?.bar &&
  path.call(() => path.node?.type === "Foo", "foo", "bar");
```

Since Prettier main, accessing a property of nullish properties no longer throws errors.
