#### Fix loading ESM-style shared config file in Node.js 23 (#16857 by @sosukesuzuki)

In Prettier 3.3, attempting to load an ESM-style [shared config file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/sharing-configurations) in Node.js 23 resulted in the following warnings, preventing the options from being loaded:

```
[warn] Ignored unknown option { __esModule: true }.
[warn] Ignored unknown option { default: { trailingComma: "es5", tabWidth: 4, singleQuote: true } }.
```

This issue was caused by a new module feature in Node.js 23, known as [`require(ESM)`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-ecmascript-modules-using-require). Prettier 3.4 resolves this problem, allowing the options to load correctly.
