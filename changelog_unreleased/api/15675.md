# Stop look for config file outside project (#15675 by @fisker)

When looking for the `.editorconfig` file, Prettier doesn't climb all the way up the file system. It finds the 'project root'(a directory contains `.git` or `.hg` directory) and stops there. It would make sense to adjust the resolution of configuration files the same way.

- Prettier should be configured on the project-level, its configuration should be part of the project.
- It's encouraged to use Prettier with default settings, which means without a configuration file. It also means that if there is a configuration file in some parent directory, it can unexpectedly affect formatting.
- It's inconsistent that `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc` are resolved differently.

Prettier main fixes the inconsistency, and stop search for `.prettierrc` outside project too.
