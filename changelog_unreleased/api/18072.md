#### Allow plugin to provide an `estree` printer (#18072 by @fisker)

Previously, if a plugin wanted to make a plugin with `estree` printer that outputs different code based on the built-in one, plugin need provide both `parsers` and `printers`. Prettier main allows a plugin to create a plugin that only provides `estree` printer.
