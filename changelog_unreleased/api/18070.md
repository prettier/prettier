#### Add support for `plugin.printer.printPrettierIgnored()` (#18070 by @fisker)

For a node with `prettier-ignore` comment, Prettier prints the text of the node directly. However, this may cause problems, for example, the node needs to be parenthesized or needs to print a leading semicolon to prevent ASI issue in `--no-semi` mode.

Since Prettier main, plugins can add `printPrettierIgnored()` function to the printer to customize the `prettier-ignore`d node print process. This function uses the extract same signature as [`plugin.printer.print()`](https://prettier.io/docs/plugins#print)
