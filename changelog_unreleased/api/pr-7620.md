#### [BREAKING] Remove the `version` parameter of `prettier.getSupportInfo()` ([#7620](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/pull/7620) by [@thorn0](https://github.com/thorn0))

In Prettier 1.x (since 1.8.0), it was possible to pass a version number to `prettier.getSupportInfo()` to get information on the languages, options, etc. supported by previous versions. This interesting but apparently not very useful API kept causing maintenance problems and has been removed in Prettier 2.0.0.
