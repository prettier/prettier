#### Add `isSupported` function support for `languages` API (#17331 by @JounQin)

Previously, `languages` API for custom plugin only supported to infer parser based on the file basename or extension.

Prettier main added `isSupported: (file: string) => boolean` function to allow plugin check if file is supported based on the full path (eg: files in a specific directory), the `file` parameter could be a normal path or a url string like `file:///C:/test.txt`.

If no `isSupported` provided, it just behaviors the same way as before.

```js
export const languages = [
  {
    name: "foo",
    parsers: ["foo"],
    isSupported: (file) => file.includes(".foo"),
  },
];
```
