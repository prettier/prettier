#### Add `isSupported` function support for `languages` API (#17331 by @JounQin, #17490 by @fisker)

Previously, `languages` API for custom plugin only supported to infer parser based on the file basename or extension.

Prettier main added `isSupported: ({ filepath: string }) => boolean` function to allow plugin check if file is supported based on the full path (eg: files in a specific directory).

:::note

Prettier can not ensure that `filepath` exists on disk.\
When using from APIs(eg: `prettier.format()`), Prettier can not ensure it's a valid path either.

:::

If no `isSupported` provided, it just behaviors the same way as before.

```js
export const languages = [
  {
    name: "foo",
    parsers: ["foo"],
    isSupported: ({ filepath }) => filepath.includes(".foo"),
  },
];
```
