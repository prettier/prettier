#### Add `isSupported` function support for `languages` API (#17331 by @JounQin)

Previously, `languages` API for custom plugin only supported to infer parser based on base `filename`, only exactly matched `filename` is supported. This PR added `isSupported` function with `file: string` as parameter to check if the `file` is supported by the plugin, `file` could be plain string path or url string like `file:///C:/test.txt`.

```js
export const languages = [
  {
    name: "foo",
    parsers: ["foo"],
    isSupported: (file) => file.includes(".foo"),
  },
];
```
