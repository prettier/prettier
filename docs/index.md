title: What is Prettier?
---

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter with support for:

- JavaScript (including experimental features)
- [JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Flow](https://flow.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- CSS, [Less](http://lesscss.org/), and [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
- [JSON](https://json.org/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
- [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/), including [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- [YAML](https://yaml.org/)

It removes all original styling[\*](#footnotes) and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. (See this [blog post](https://jlongster.com/A-Prettier-Formatter))

Prettier takes your code and reprints it from scratch by taking the line length into account.

For example, take the following code:

```js
foo(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4);
```

It fits in a single line so it’s going to stay as is. However, we've all run into this situation:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
foo(reallyLongArg(), omgSoManyParameters(), IShouldRefactorThis(), isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne());
```

Suddenly our previous format for calling function breaks down because this is too long. Prettier is going to do the painstaking work of reprinting it like that for you:

```js
foo(
  reallyLongArg(),
  omgSoManyParameters(),
  IShouldRefactorThis(),
  isThereSeriouslyAnotherOne()
);
```

Prettier enforces a consistent code **style** (i.e. code formatting that won’t affect the AST) across your entire codebase because it disregards the original styling[\*](#footnotes) by parsing it away and re-printing the parsed AST with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

#### Footnotes

\* _Well actually, some original styling is preserved when practical—see [empty lines](rationale.md#empty-lines) and [multi-line objects](rationale.md#multi-line-objects)._
