Vim users can install either [vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier), which is Prettier specific, or [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat) or [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) which are generalized lint/format engines with support for Prettier.

## [vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier)

See the [vim-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/vim-prettier) readme for installation and usage instructions.

## [Neoformat](https://github.com/sbdchd/neoformat)

The best way to install Neoformat is with your favorite plugin manager for Vim, such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'sbdchd/neoformat'
```

In order for Neoformat to use a project-local version of Prettier (i.e. to use `node_modules/.bin/prettier` instead of looking for `prettier` on `$PATH`), you must set the `neoformat_try_node_exe` option:

```vim
let g:neoformat_try_node_exe = 1
```

Run `:Neoformat` or `:Neoformat prettier` in a supported file to run Prettier.

To have Neoformat run Prettier on save:

```vim
autocmd BufWritePre *.js Neoformat
```

You can also make Vim format your code more frequently, by setting an `autocmd` for other events. Here are a couple of useful ones:

- `TextChanged`: after a change was made to the text in Normal mode
- `InsertLeave`: when leaving Insert mode

For example, you can format on both of the above events together with `BufWritePre` like this:

```vim
autocmd BufWritePre,TextChanged,InsertLeave *.js Neoformat
```

See `:help autocmd-events` in Vim for details.

It’s recommended to use a [config file](configuration.md), but you can also add options in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
autocmd FileType javascript setlocal formatprg=prettier\ --single-quote\ --trailing-comma\ es5
" Use formatprg when available
let g:neoformat_try_formatprg = 1
```

Each space in Prettier options should be escaped with `\`.

## [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale)

ALE requires either Vim 8 or Neovim as ALE makes use of the asynchronous abilities that both Vim 8 and Neovim provide.

The best way to install ALE is with your favorite plugin manager for Vim, such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'dense-analysis/ale'
```

You can find further instructions on the [ALE repository](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale#3-installation).

ALE will try to use Prettier installed locally before looking for a global installation.

Enable the Prettier fixer for the languages you use:

```vim
let g:ale_fixers = {
\   'javascript': ['prettier'],
\   'css': ['prettier'],
\}
```

ALE supports both _linters_ and _fixers_. If you don’t specify which _linters_ to run, **all available tools for all supported languages will be run,** and you might get a correctly formatted file with a bunch of lint errors. To disable this behavior you can tell ALE to run only linters you've explicitly configured (more info in the [FAQ](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale/blob/ed8104b6ab10f63c78e49b60d2468ae2656250e9/README.md#faq-disable-linters)):

```vim
let g:ale_linters_explicit = 1
```

You can then run `:ALEFix` in a JavaScript or CSS file to run Prettier.

To have ALE run Prettier on save:

```vim
let g:ale_fix_on_save = 1
```

It’s recommended to use a [config file](configuration.md), but you can also add options in your `.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:ale_javascript_prettier_options = '--single-quote --trailing-comma all'
```

## [coc-prettier](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-prettier)

Prettier extension for [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) which requires neovim or vim8.1.
Install coc.nvim with your favorite plugin manager, such as [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```vim
Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim', {'branch': 'release'}
```

And install coc-prettier by command:

```vim
CocInstall coc-prettier
```

Setup `Prettier` command in your `init.vim` or `.vimrc`

```vim
command! -nargs=0 Prettier :call CocAction('runCommand', 'prettier.formatFile')
```

Update your `coc-settings.json` for languages that you want format on save.

```json
{
  "coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes": ["css", "markdown"]
}
```

[coc-prettier](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-prettier) have same configurations of [prettier-vscode](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode), open `coc-settings.json` by `:CocConfig` to get autocompletion support.

## Running manually

If you want something really bare-bones, you can create a custom key binding. In this example, `gp` (mnemonic: "get pretty") is used to run prettier (with options) in the currently active buffer:

```vim
nnoremap gp :silent %!prettier --stdin-filepath %<CR>
```

Note that if there’s a syntax error in your code, the whole buffer will be replaced with an error message. You’ll need to press `u` to get your code back.

Another disadvantage of this approach is that the cursor position won’t be preserved.
