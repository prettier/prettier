  "description": "Prettier, an opinionated code formatter for JavaScript and many web languages, has been accepting donations at OpenCollective since 2019 and thanks to many generous donations we now have \\$50,000 in the bank! As a result, we are now able to pay the two active maintainers \\$1,500/month each. This funding will ensure that they will be able to continue consistent maintenance of Prettier into the future.",
