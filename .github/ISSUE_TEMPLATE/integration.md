    A large number of opened issues are duplicates of existing issues.
    If someone has already opened an issue for what you are experiencing,
    you do not need to open a new issue — please add a 👍 reaction to the
    existing issue instead.

2.  If your issue is with a Prettier editor extension or add-on, please open the
    issue in the repo for that extension or add-on, instead of this repo.
