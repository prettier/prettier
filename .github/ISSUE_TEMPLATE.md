<!--

BEFORE SUBMITTING AN ISSUE:

1. Search for your issue on GitHub: https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues
   A large number of opened issues are duplicates of existing issues.
   If someone has already opened an issue for what you are experiencing,
   you do not need to open a new issue — please add a 👍 reaction to the
   existing issue instead.

2. We get a lot of requests for adding options, but Prettier is
   built on the principle of being opinionated about code formatting.
   This means we have a very high bar for adding new options.
   Find out more: https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy.html

3. If your issue is with a prettier editor extension or add-on, please open the
   issue in the repo for that extension or add-on, instead of this repo.

For ugly or incorrect code issues: Please use the below template.

Tip! Don't write this stuff manually.

1. Go to https://prettier.io/playground
2. Paste your code and set options
3. Press the "Report issue" button in the lower right
