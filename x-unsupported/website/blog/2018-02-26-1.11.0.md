title: "Prettier 1.11: CSS fixes and new TypeScript feature support"
---

This release features a ton of CSS formatting fixes as well as support for some new TypeScript features, in addition to some general bugfixes for other languages.

Since the last release, the [Prettier website](https://prettier.io) has gotten an all-new design thanks to [@orta](https://github.com/orta)!

### Facebook is 💯% Prettier

Another exciting announcement is that all the JavaScript files in the Facebook codebase have now been converted to Prettier! What's mind-blowing is that there hasn't been a concerted push to convert the codebase to Prettier, we just added the tooling in place and documentation on how to migrate a folder to Prettier and people just started converting their piece of the codebase.

In 8 months, 75% of the codebase was organically converted and last week we did a final push to convert the rest and enforce that every file from now on is using Prettier! It shows that Prettier is robust to support all the crazy edge cases you can imagine and also that it provides a lot of value given the crazy adoption rate.

## Highlights

### CSS/SCSS/Less

Our CSS formatting got a lot of love from [@evilebottnawi] during this release!

#### Format at-rules ([#3828] by [@evilebottnawi])

Previously, some at-rules (like `@if` and `@include`) were not formatted by Prettier and were instead printed as-is. They are now formatted:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before:
.selector {
  @include absolute($top: $long-variable-name, $right: $long-variable-name, $left: auto, $bottom: auto);
}

// After:
.selector {
  @include absolute(
    $top: $long-variable-name,
    $right: $long-variable-name,
    $left: auto,
    $bottom: auto
  );
}
```

#### Support popular PostCSS plugins ([#3959] by [@evilebottnawi])

Some popular PostCSS plugins like [postcss-mixins](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-mixins) were not working due to how Prettier was formatting CSS. These plugins are now respected:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before
$theme: blue;

a {
  @mixin $(theme) -colors;
}

// After
$theme: blue;

a {
  @mixin $(theme)-colors;
}
```

#### Support YAML front-matter block in SCSS ([#3802] by [@evilebottnawi])

Jekyll relies on YAML front-matter to detect SCSS files, but Prettier was removing it, which would break Jekyll sites when deployed. The YAML front-matter is now preserved, which preserves styling:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
---
title: Title
description: Description
---

a {
  color: red;
}
```

### TypeScript

#### Support definite assignment (`!:`) ([#4020] by [@ikatyang])

TypeScript 2.7 added a new feature called definite assignment that can be used in class property initializers. It informs TypeScript that even though a class property does not have an initializer, we can be sure that at runtime it will have a value, rather than `undefined`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
class MyComponent {
  ngModel!: ng.INgModelController;
}
```

Prettier 1.10.2 couldn't parse this syntax:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
SyntaxError: '=' expected. (2:10)
  1 | class MyComponent {
> 2 |   ngModel!: ng.INgModelController;
    |          ^
  3 | }
```

But it is now supported in Prettier 1.11.0.

#### Support `unique symbol` ([#3967] by [@ikatyang])

TypeScript 2.7 also added a new `unique symbol` type:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
interface SymbolConstructor {
  readonly iterator: unique symbol;
}
```

Prettier 1.10.2 couldn't parse this syntax:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
SyntaxError: ';' expected. (2:29)
  1 | interface SymbolConstructor {
> 2 |   readonly iterator: unique symbol;
    |                             ^
  3 | }
  4 |
```

But it is now supported in Prettier 1.11.0.

#### Support condition types ([#4006] by [@Cryrivers])

TypeScript 2.8 will add support for conditional types, which look like ternaries but appear in a type position:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
export type DeepReadonly<T> =
    T extends any[] ? DeepReadonlyArray<T[number]> :
    T extends object ? DeepReadonlyObject<T> :
    T;
```

Prettier 1.10.2 couldn't parse these:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
SyntaxError: ';' expected. (2:7)
  1 | export type DeepReadonly<T> =
> 2 |     T extends any[] ? DeepReadonlyArray<T[number]> :
    |       ^
  3 |     T extends object ? DeepReadonlyObject<T> :
  4 |     T;
```

But this syntax is supported in Prettier 1.11.0.

### JavaScript

#### Ternaries were indented incorrectly with `--use-tabs` ([#3745] by [@ikatyang])

Because tabs can be represented as different widths, Prettier was sometimes indenting ternaries incorrectly when using tabs. Now we calculate the indentation properly:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Before:
const abc = props.something
	? xyz
	: {
			prop1: a,
			prop2: b,
			prop3: false,
		};

// After:
const abc = props.something
	? xyz
	: {
			prop1: a,
			prop2: b,
			prop3: false
	  };
```

## Other Changes

### CSS/SCSS/Less

#### Lists of lists now have cleaner formatting ([#3930] by [@evilebottnawi])

We weren't handling lists of lists very well in SCSS. Now we handle them better.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before:
$space-scale: (0, "0") (0.25, "0-25") (0.5, "0-5") (0.75, "0-75") (1, "1")
  (
    1.25,
    "1-25"
  ) (1.5, "1-5") (1.75, "1-75") (2, "2") (2.25, "2-25") (2.5, "2-5")
  (
    2.75,
    "2-75"
  ) (3, "3") (3.25, "3-25") (3.5, "3-5") (3.75, "3-75") (4, "4");

// After:
$space-scale: (0, "0") (0.25, "0-25") (0.5, "0-5") (0.75, "0-75") (1, "1")
  (1.25, "1-25") (1.5, "1-5") (1.75, "1-75") (2, "2") (2.25, "2-25")
  (2.5, "2-5") (2.75, "2-75") (3, "3") (3.25, "3-25") (3.5, "3-5")
  (3.75, "3-75") (4, "4");
```

#### Preserve comment in font-face declaration ([#3906] by [@evilebottnawi])

Previously, if you had code like this:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Prettier";
  src: local("Prettier"), /* Local */
    url("http://prettier.com/font.woff") /* Network*/
}
```

Then the "Local" comment was removed by Prettier:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Prettier";
  src: local("Prettier"), url("http://prettier.com/font.woff"); /* Network*/
}
```

It is now preserved:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Prettier";
  src: local("Prettier"), /* Local */ url("http://prettier.com/font.woff"); /* Network*/
}
```

#### CSS indentation no longer indents with 3 spaces when line starts with a paren ([#3930] by [@evilebottnawi])

If a line of CSS was to be indented and the first character in that line was a paren, the CSS was mistakenly indented with 3 spaces instead of the expected 2. Now it's indented with 2 spaces.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before:
$longVariable: (
   (mobile $mobile) (tablet $tablet) (desktop $desktop) (wide $wide)
);

// After:
$longVariable: (
  (mobile $mobile) (tablet $tablet) (desktop $desktop) (wide $wide)
);
```

#### Extra space is no longer added inside maps ([#3814] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly adding spaces inside SCSS maps. They are no longer printed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before:
$map: map-merge($map,  ($key: $value));

// After:
$map: map-merge($map, ($key: $value));
```

#### SCSS comments in selector lists no longer break formatting ([#3909] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was formatting trailing SCSS comments in CSS selector lists incorrectly, breaking code:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Before formatting:
.field {
  &[data-field-id="1"], // Name
  &[data-field-id="2"], // Email
  &[data-field-id="3"], // Postal Code
  {
    background: green;
  }
}

// After formatting (Prettier 1.10.2):
.field {
  &[data-field-id="1"],
  // Name &[data-field-id="2"],
  // Email &[data-field-id="3"] {
    background: green;
  }
}
```

Prettier now handles these comments correctly:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// After formatting (Prettier 1.11.0):
.field {
  &[data-field-id="1"], // Name
  &[data-field-id="2"], // Email
  &[data-field-id="3"], // Postal Code
 {
    background: green;
  }
}
```

#### Comma no longer added after `@import` url ([#3770] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly adding a comma after `@import` urls. This is no longer added:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
/* Before */
@import url("responsive/gt768.css"), screen and (min-width: 768px);

/* After */
@import url("responsive/gt768.css") screen and (min-width: 768px);
```

#### Handle `!default` directive properly ([#3724] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was printing the `!default` directive in an odd way:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
$theme-checkbox-colors: (
    default: $theme-color-border,
    checked: $theme-color-checked,
    disabled: $theme-color-disabled,
    disabled-font: $theme-color-font-secondary
  )
  !default;
```

It's now handled properly:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```css
$theme-checkbox-colors: (
  default: $theme-color-border,
  checked: $theme-color-checked,
  disabled: $theme-color-disabled,
  disabled-font: $theme-color-font-secondary
) !default;
```

#### Don't format contents of `@warn` and `@error` directives ([#3769] by [@evilebottnawi])

SCSS has a feature that lets you output some text at build-time using `@warn` or `@error`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
@if ($error) {
  @error 'An error occurred: (#{$error}).';
}
```

Unfortunately, Prettier was treating these directives as media queries, formatting their contents in unexpected ways (in this example, a space is added before the period):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
@if ($error) {
  @error 'error (#{$error}) .';
}
```

Prettier now handles these directives correctly, and will not change the contents of the string:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
@if ($error) {
  @error "error (#{$error}).";
}
```

#### Don't remove semicolon in Less ruleset declaration ([#3841] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly removing semicolons after Less ruleset declarations, which needed to stay, or else compilation errors would occur. They are now preserved:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```less
// Before:
@detached-ruleset: {
  background: red;
}

// After:
@detached-ruleset: {
  background: red;
};
```

#### Don't add newline to empty CSS file ([#3723] by [@hudochenkov])

Prettier was previously adding an end-of-file newline to CSS files. We didn't do this for JS files, so we decided to make this behavior consistent in CSS so that it wouldn't introduce surprising source control changes when adding Prettier to a project.

#### Ignore `media` params with SCSS interpolation ([#3801] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly breaking code when a media query contained SCSS interpolation. It is now preserved:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
$sm-only: '(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px)';
$lg-and-up: '(min-width: 1200px)';

@media screen and #{$sm-only, $lg-and-up} {
    color: #000;
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
@media screen and,  {
	color: #000;
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
$sm-only: "(min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px)";
$lg-and-up: "(min-width: 1200px)";

@media screen and #{$sm-only, $lg-and-up} {
  color: #000;
}
```

#### Don't print two spaces between selector operator and opening bracket ([#3738] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly printing an extra space when a CSS selector ended in an operator (a feature supported by SCSS). This has been fixed:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
.this > .ends > .with > .an > .operator > {
  // content
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
.this > .ends > .with > .an > .operator >  {
  // content
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
.this > .ends > .with > .an > .operator > {
  // content
}
```

#### Don't change case of SCSS function names ([#3768] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly lowercasing SCSS function names in certain cases. This has been fixed.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
@include breakpoint (getBp(md)) {
  &:nth-child(2n + 3) {
    clear: both;
  }
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
@include breakpoint (getbp(md)) {
  &:nth-child(2n + 3) {
    clear: both;
  }
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
@include breakpoint(getBp(md)) {
  &:nth-child(2n + 3) {
    clear: both;
  }
}
```

#### Keep space around Vue deep selector `>>>` ([#3792] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly stripping spaces around Vue's deep selector:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- Unformatted code: -->
<style scoped>
  .box >>> .child-component {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
</style>

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2): -->
<style scoped>
  .box>>>.child-component {
    font-size: 24px;
  }
</style>

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0): -->
<style scoped>
.box >>> .child-component {
  font-size: 24px;
}
</style>
```

#### Fix `@nest` at-rule ([#3975] by [@evilebottnawi])

Prettier was mistakenly adding spaces around the `&` character in selectors passed to `@nest`, which changed which selector the rule compiled into. This has been fixed:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
.title {
  @nest :global(h1)& {
    background: red;
  }
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
.title {
  @nest :global(h1) & {
    background: red;
  }
}

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
.title {
  @nest :global(h1)& {
    background: red;
  }
}
```

#### Format `progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient` as-is ([#4028] by [@evilebottnawi])

In Prettier 1.10.2, we had a lot of logic to handle formatting of Microsoft-browser-specific filter values, but they still weren't formatting very well. Since they are non-standard and infrequently used, we've decided to print them as-is without attempting to format them.

#### Don't lowercase nesting selector ([#4048] by [@evilebottnawi])

In Prettier 1.10.2, we were incorrectly lower-casing nesting SCSS selectors:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Unformatted code:
.foo {
  &-1Bar {
  }
}

// Formatted code: (Prettier 1.10.2):
.foo {
  &-1bar {
  }
}
```

This has been fixed in Prettier 1.11.0:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```scss
// Formatted code: (Prettier 1.11.0):
.foo {
  &-1Bar {
  }
}

```

### JavaScript

#### Don't print odd-looking parens around return argument with comment ([#3665] by [@duailibe])

Prettier was printing parens around the argument to a `return` statement in an odd way when the argument contained a comment. These parens are now formatted better.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Unformatted code:
func1(function() {
  return func2
      //comment
      .bar();
});

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
func1(function() {
  return (func2
      //comment
      .bar() );
});

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
func1(function() {
  return (
    func2
      //comment
      .bar()
  );
});
```

#### Respect 0-indent markdown-in-js ([#3676] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier's markdown-in-js formatting (triggered by using a template literal tag named `md` was inserting indentation):

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Unformatted code
md`
This is some markdown
`

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2)
md`
  This is some markdown
`;
```

This was desired and acceptable behavior for many markdown template tag functions, such as `react-markings`, but it broke some other in-house markdown formatters.

Prettier 1.11.0 will now respect the indentation level you set in your markdown, so users of template tag functions like the one provided by `react-markings` can continue to indent their code, and users of other template tag functions which do not support indentation can choose not to.

#### Format AMD define calls like CJS require calls ([#3830] by [@salemhilal])

When using AMD modules, one pattern is to use `define` to specify the dependencies of an anonymous module like so:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
define([
  "jquery",
  "common/global.context",
  "common/log.event",
  "some_project/square",
  "some_project/rectangle",
  "some_project/triangle",
  "some_project/circle",
  "some_project/star"
], function($, Context, EventLogger, Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Star) {
  console.log("some code");
});
```

Prettier 1.10.2 was breaking this onto multiple lines, which introduced a lot of top-level indentation:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
define(
  [
    "jquery",
    "common/global.context",
    "common/log.event",
    "some_project/square",
    "some_project/rectangle",
    "some_project/triangle",
    "some_project/circle",
    "some_project/star"
  ],
  function($, Context, EventLogger, Square, Rectangle, Triangle, Circle, Star) {
    console.log("some code");
  }
);
```

Prettier 1.11.0 will now make the array and function expression "hug", which decreases the indentation level:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
define([
  "jquery",
  "common/global.context",
  "common/log.event",
  "some_project/square",
  "some_project/rectangle",
  "some_project/triangle",
  "some_project/circle",
  "some_project/star"
], function(
  $,
  Context,
  EventLogger,
  Square,
  Rectangle,
  Triangle,
  Circle,
  Star
) {
  console.log("some code");
});
```

#### Format QUnit's `skip` like `test` ([#3735] by [@tmquinn])

Prettier was special-casing formatting for `describe`, `it`, and `test` to improve formatting in tests based on user expectations and requests. However, we were not formatting QUnit's `skip` method using the same logic, which led to mixed formatting when switching a test between `test` and `skip`:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Unformatted code
test("this is a really long description of some test I want to go here", function (assert) {
  assert("something");
});

skip("this is a really long description of some test I want to go here", function (assert) {
  assert("something");
});

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
test("this is a really long description of some test I want to go here", function(assert) {
  assert("something");
});

skip(
  "this is a really long description of some test I want to go here",
  function(assert) {
    assert("something");
  }
);
```

We now treat `skip` the same as `describe`, `it`, and `test`, which makes QUnit tests look more uniform:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
test("this is a really long description of some test I want to go here", function(assert) {
  assert("something");
});

skip("this is a really long description of some test I want to go here", function(assert) {
  assert("something");
});
```

#### Break JSX element if a string literal prop has a newline ([#4011] by [@duailibe])

Newline characters are allowed within a JSX string literal according to the JSX spec, but Prettier was not treating a JSX element as multi-line when one of its attribute values was a string containing a newline character. Prettier will now treat these elements as multi-line as expected:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
// Unformatted code:
<path d="M4.765 16.829l3.069-2.946 5.813 5.748
  11.33-11.232 3.006 3.18-14.36 14.080z"
/>;

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
<path d="M4.765 16.829l3.069-2.946 5.813 5.748
  11.33-11.232 3.006 3.18-14.36 14.080z" />;

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
<path
  d="M4.765 16.829l3.069-2.946 5.813 5.748
  11.33-11.232 3.006 3.18-14.36 14.080z"
/>;
```

#### Support JSX children spread with flow parser ([#3899] by [@vjeux])

Using a spread operator in a JSX children expression container position caused a parsing error in Prettier 1.10.2 when using the flow parser:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
<JSX>
  {...edges}
</JSX>
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```jsx
SyntaxError: Unexpected token ... (2:4)
  1 | <JSX>
> 2 |   {...edges}
    |    ^^^
  3 | </JSX>
```

In Prettier 1.11.0, this syntax is supported with the flow parser.

#### Fix error when printing flow maybe object return type ([#3948] by [@azz])

In Prettier 1.10.2, this code caused an error to be thrown:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
function getScaledData({x}): ?{foo: number} {}
```

It has been fixed in Prettier 1.11.0.

#### `--insert-pragma` no longer removes duplicate pragmas ([#3947] by [@azz])

Using `--insert-pragma` on code with duplicate pragmas was removing all but one of the duplicates. This has been fixed:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Unformatted code:
/**
 * @x 1
 * @x 2
 */

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
/**
 * @format
 * @x 2
 */

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
/**
 * @format
 * @x 1
 * @x 2
 */
```

#### Wrap flow-typecasted ternaries in parens ([#3940] by [@j-f1])

To improve code clarity, typecast ternaries will now be wrapped in parens:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
// Unformatted code:
const foo = ((1?2:3): number);

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
const foo = (1 ? 2 : 3: number);

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
const foo = ((1 ? 2 : 3): number);
```

#### Fix cases with missing semi when printing DeclareExportDeclaration ([#3979] by [@existentialism])

Semicolons were being mistakenly removed from `declare export default` statements in flow library definition files. This has been fixed.

### TypeScript

#### Don't remove parens from `(void 0)!` ([#3989] by [@azz])

Prettier was mistakenly removing parens from `(void 0)!`, which changed the AST of the program. This has been fixed.

#### Properly chain when there is a TSNonNullExpression ([#4005] by [@ericanderson])

Prettier was not using its chaining formatting style when the chain included a TypeScript `!` non-null expression. This has been fixed:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```ts
// Unformatted code:
this.tokenLoads.get(locator).get(start).push({});

this.tokenLoads.get(locator)!.get(start).push({});

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2):
this.tokenLoads
  .get(locator)
  .get(start)
  .push({});

this.tokenLoads.get(locator)!.get(start).push({});

// Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0):
this.tokenLoads
  .get(locator)
  .get(start)
  .push({});

this.tokenLoads
  .get(locator)!
  .get(start)
  .push({});
```

### Markdown

#### Heading after list item gets merged into list ([#3780] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier was mistakenly merging a heading beneath a list item into the list. Now it is treated as a header:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Unformatted code -->
* Something
### Some heading

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2) -->
* Something

#### Don't parse HTML entities in link URLs ([#3780] by [@ikatyang])

Links whose URL contained HTML entities were mistakenly being changed when run through Prettier. They are now preserved.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Unformatted code -->
[Test](http://localhost:8080/test?language=DE&currency=EUR)

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2) -->

#### Fix indentation of template strings within code blocks ([#3676] by [@ikatyang])

Indentation of JS tagged template string content within markdown code blocks was being calculated incorrectly:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Unformatted code: -->
- 1
  - 2
    - 3
      ```js
      something`
      asd

      asd

      asd
      `
      ```

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2): -->
* 1

  * 2

    * 3

      ```js
      something`
asd

asd

asd
`;
      ```
```

It has been fixed in Prettier 1.11.0:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0): -->
* 1

  * 2

    * 3

      ```js
      something`
      asd

      asd

      asd
      `;
      ```
```

#### Print multiline content correctly in footnoteDefinition ([#3787] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier was mistakenly using the incorrect level of indentation when printing a footnote that contained a code block. This has been fixed:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
``````md
<!-- Unformatted code: -->
Some text.[^fn]

[^fn]: Here is a footnote which includes code.

    ```rs
    fn main() {
        println!("this is some Rust!");
    }
    ```

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.10.2): -->
Some text.[^fn]

[^fn]: Here is a footnote which includes code.

```rs
fn main() {
    println!("this is some Rust!");
}
```

<!-- Formatted code (Prettier 1.11.0): -->
Some text.[^fn]

[^fn]: Here is a footnote which includes code.

  ```rs
  fn main() {
      println!("this is some Rust!");
  }
  ```
``````

#### Respect `tabWidth` for list items ([#3990] by [@ikatyang])

We've discovered that CommonMark diverges from the original Markdown syntax for code blocks in list items. This leads to scenarios where indented code-blocks in Markdown where being rendered as regular paragraphs. This change uses the `tabWidth` option to determine how much indentation to use in list items. Have a read through [#3459] if you're interested in the details.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```md
<!-- before -->
1. Change to your home directory:

   cd

<!-- after -->
1. Change to your home directory:

        cd
```

This change should also improve indentation in text editors:

### API

#### Support options in plugins ([#3775] by [@ikatyang])

As part of fleshing out our beta plugin API for community-made language plugins, we have added support for plugins to define their own options!

Plugin options can now be printed in help:

```sh
prettier --plugin @prettier/plugin-python --help
```

Likewise, plugin options can be specified on the command-line:

```sh
prettier --plugin my-cool-prettier-plugin --my-custom-option
```

And plugin options can also be defined in `.prettierrc`:

```json
{ "plugins": ["foo-plugin"], "fooOption": "bar" }
```

#### Don't allow kebab-cased options in config files ([#3622] by [@ikatyang])

Prettier was mistakenly allowing kebab-case variations of options in `.prettierrc` files:

```json
{ "print-width": 100 }
```

This was not intended to be allowed, and has been reverted (in this case, you would need to use `printWidth`).

### Configuration

#### Respect EditorConfig when `--config` is passed ([#3992] by [@josephfrazier])

This is a minor change to the the way `.editorconfig` files are handled. Previously when `--config` was provided, `.editorconfig` was ignored.
