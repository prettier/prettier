<!-- At the time of adding this test, the cursor positioning we end up with
     here seems clearly wrong.
     I'm adding the test case anyway to demonstrate the brokenness and ensure
     that if a future changes fixes it, it'll be obvious from the PR diff that
     the fix happened.
     Remove this comment if and when we fix it! -->
