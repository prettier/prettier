> NOTE: To use `unobtrusive`, `unobtrusive/import`, `unobtrusive/react`, and `unobtrusive/flowtype` together, your eslint config would look like this:
>```json
>{
>  "extends": [
>    "unobtrusive",
>    "unobtrusive/import",
>    "unobtrusive/react",
>    "unobtrusive/flowtype"
>  ],
>  "env": {
>    "browser": true
>  }
>}
>```
